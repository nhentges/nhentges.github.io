									<h2>Company Mobile Apps</h2>
									<p>I have designed and devolped a custom mobile app that provides safety resources and reporting services. The app includes dynamic form building that is connected to Firebase for backend funcitonality. The Android version was programmed natively in Java and the iOS version was programmed natively in Swift.</p>

									<h2>Custom Invoice Processing Software</h2>
									<p>I have developed custom invoice processing software that decreased total processing time by 50%. It detects and fixes errors on invoices, provides intelligent suggestions for missing data, compiles all invoices into one file, and converts it to the correct format to be easily uploaded to their accounting software. </p>

									<h2>Undergraduate Acedemic Research</h2>
									<p>I have conducted acedemic research since my freshman year of college, co-authoring 7 acedemic papers and presenting my findings at international conferences. My research primarily focused on renewable fuels, nanofuels, and fluid mechanics.</p>

							<h2>Why I am interested</h2>
							<p>Your company is the intersection of two passions of mine, software development and acedemic research. Being able to work on both would be a dream come true!</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class=""></span>
									<h3>My passion for programming</h3>
									<p>Though my previous work I discovered that programming is a passion of mine, being able to directly apply logic to solve problems through code is something that I find extremely enjoyable! </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class=""></span>
									<h3>My passion for acedemic research</h3>
									<p>I have a great passion for acedemic reasearch, it is always amazing when you discover something completely unknown. Being able to aid the scientific community is something that interests me greatly.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class=""></span>
									<h3>Team size</h3>
									<p>With my previous experience of working solo on software projects, I am very interested in working with a team! I believe that your smaller team size would be a good fit for me. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class=""></span>
									<h3>Company culture</h3>
									<p>Your company culture aligns with many of my own values, such as an ability to learn new things and work autonomously. In developing custom software, I have done so without a team to guide me and have had to learn new programming languages in the process. These values have always been present in my work and I am always seeking to further develop them! </p>

				<section id="three" class="wrapper style1 fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2>Why I would be a great addition to your team</h2>
						<p>I believe I would be a great fit for your team, I am extemely passionate about the work that your clients conduct, and would love to help design software to aid them in their work!</p>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class=""></span>
								<h3>Pervious experience with clients</h3>
								<p>I already have hands on experience with developing custom software from scratch for clients. I've learned how to help clients better understand the problem they face so I can provide a better product for them. </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class=""></span>
								<h3>Previous experience with research</h3>
								<p>I have alot of experience with acedemic research, having co-authored 7 acedemic papers and presented my findings at the International Mechancial Engineering Congress and Exposition the past three years.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class=""></span>
								<h3>Ability to adapt to problems with steep learning curves</h3>
								<p>In my past experiences I was always asked to solve complex problems that I have never faced before, such as designing a custom experimental setup from scratch or to design mobile apps from the ground up without development experience. I've always been able to meet these steep learning curves and have learned greatly from them. </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class=""></span>
								<h3>I love solving cutting-edge and novel problems</h3>
								<p>I have always been drawn to solving problems without a clear solution, and I have enjoyed the process of discovering and implementing that solution.</p>
